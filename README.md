# CS-UY4613
code for projects CS-UY4613

This is a modified proxybot for use in our MetaBot project for CS-UY4613

http://eis.ucsc.edu/StarProxyBot


Some important details for accompanying VM:
Make sure to use the updated VM.

Set whatever the IP of the proxybot is listening on (probably one of your host adapters) in proxybotnetworkinit.cmd, and run it on the host.
